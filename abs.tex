  \textbf{Hardware prefetching has been introduced in modern
    processors as a way to hide cache latencies.  An efficient
    prefetcher should be able to identify complex memory access
    patterns during a program execution.  This enables it to fetch a
    block ahead of its demand access, potentially saving a cache miss.
  }

  \textbf{In this paper, we introduce perceptron learning to help make
    this prefetching decision efficiently.  We have taken a state of
    the art prefetcher - Signature Path Prefetcher (SPP) as the
    underlying prefetch engine.  The perceptron layer acts as a
    throttler to filter out the unnecessary prefetches recommended by
    SPP.  We have also explored a range of features that can be used
    to train the perceptron layer.  Our results show that SPP-Perc
    improves performance on the memory intensive subset of the SPEC
    2017 Benchmark suite by 6.84\% on single-core and by 11.9\% on
    multi-core traces, as compared to just SPP.  We also demonstrate
    that the performance gained from using our efficient throttler
    scales better with increasing number of cores.  }
