\label{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced perceptron-based learning for data prefetching.
The perceptron filter acts independently as a check on the underlying prefetch
engine.  PPF improves performance of the base prefetcher used in isolation, 
by 11.9\%.  We believe that this is a robust and adaptable technique 
that can be used to enhance any existing and upcoming prefetchers.
