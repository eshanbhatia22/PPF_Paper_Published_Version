\section{CONCLUSION}
\label{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced neural network based learning for data
prefetching in the form of NATCH.  Perceptron acts an orthogonal
throttler to the underlying prefetch engine.  NATCH improves
performance by over XX\% over the baseline, which corresponds to YY\%
over the next best performing prefetcher.  
We believe that this is a robust and adaptable technique which can
be used to enhance any existing or upcoming prefetchers.
