\section{CONCLUSION}
In this paper, we introduced perceptron based learning for data
prefetching in the form of SPP-Perc.  Perceptron acts an orthogonal
throttler to the underlying prefetch engine.  SPP-Perc improves
performance by over XX\% over the baseline, which corresponds to YY\%
over the next best performing prefetcher.  We believe this paper can
lead to interesting future work like generalizing SPP-Perc to work
with any prefetcher with minimal knowledge of the underlying
prefetcher architecture.
