In this paper, we introduce perceptron-based learning for prefetching.  The
perceptron filter acts independently as a check on the underlying prefetch
engine.  PPF improves performance over the base prefetcher by 11.9\%.  We
believe that this is a robust and adaptable technique that can be used to
enhance any existing and upcoming prefetchers.
